# Mod. 14 - Testing - Class 01 - Question 01

This repository contains a function for summing two numbers in TypeScript. The function is located in the file /src/sum.ts.

## Tests

The file /test/sum.test.ts contains three tests for the sum function. The tests use the Jest testing framework and check that the function returns the expected results for different combinations of input.

-   The first test checks that the function returns the correct result for the sum of 20 and 10.
-   The second test checks that the function returns the correct result for the sum of -10 and 10.
-   The third test checks that the function returns the correct result for the sum of 2 and 2.

## How to execute the tests

To run the tests, execute the following command in the root of the project directory:

```
npm rum dev
```

This command will run the tests using TypeScript development mode (tsnd) to allow continuous execution of the tests during development.

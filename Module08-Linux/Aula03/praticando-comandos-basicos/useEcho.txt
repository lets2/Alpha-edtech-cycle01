I add this message to be fun
if you use two arrows (>>),add content in file, but if you use only one (>), the previous content wil be replaced and you will lose everything
for example: echo (some word between quotes) >> file.txt, add a message on file, if your file doesnt exist so is create
one line \ another line
second test another lineaaa
aaaaa
I will insert some more informations about 
my experience with English.
So, I need you give a strong hug

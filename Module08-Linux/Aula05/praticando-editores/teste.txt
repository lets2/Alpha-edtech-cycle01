Now Im writing about my first experience with Vim editor
I need press down "i" key to activate the insert mode
The line below was copied with Normal mode using 
some shortcuts like: V,p,$,0, All are very useful
But I need to be continue practice more and more
I need press down "i" key to activate the insert mode
To change to Normal mode just press "Esc" key.
Vim counts with 4 modes. It starts with Normal mode
To exit use Esc to change to normal mode, next, 
press ":x" and press Enter, Vim saves and  ends the program.
This mode opened when you press "Esc"+":" is known as Command Mode
